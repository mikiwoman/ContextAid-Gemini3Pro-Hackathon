# ContextAid-Gemini3Pro-Hackathon
he daily frustration of medical uncertainty during minor accidents is solved by ContextAid, a dynamic first-aid assistant built with Gemini 3 Pro. We leverage Gemini’s advanced native multimodality to create a solution that was previously impossible.  Users upload an image or video of a minor injury (cut, burn, sprain).
